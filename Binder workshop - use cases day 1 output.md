# Binder workshop - use cases day 1 output

Ideas:
- ~~Mining bitcoins~~:(
- Team sharing/close to open (collaborative environment) - being able to track how data was transformed by a notebook and under which flow that happened
- Group projects
- Interactive gists
- [Lorena's collection/zero entry notebooks](https://github.com/barbagroup/AeroPython) - example starting workflows (edu/training)
- Jupyter templates - suggestions on what to document where and how to document - standards, best practices, checklists in coding notebooks
- Thesis dissertations as a gateway drug
- Discipline specific use cases
- Workshop environments
- Demonstration
- Research - quality control data, CI
- Annotations on notebooks
- Grading/self assessment/feedback in general/fix one thing/quizzes
- Interactive slide shows when there is a new slide plugin
- Interactive widgets
- Journalism/data drive narratives
- Gateway to programming and data analysis
- Visual algorithms/python tutor etc.
- Laptop independent computing
- Publications
- Open educational resources
- Reverse notebook lookup
- Tracking dependencies/trends
- Popular notebooks, internal peer review
- Bring me this data to binder, layer on top of open science framework
