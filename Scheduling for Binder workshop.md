# Scheduling for Binder workshop

> Note: This is written in a style of a "finished" document. It absolutely isn't, so feel free to edit things or annotate when we need to discuss. The reason to write it like this is to help keep it concrete and so we can just flick a switch to make it public/official.

How is this going to work? Most of the time is to be scheduled by you. We start off with a short welcome talk(s) and a closing session to share what happened in the parallel streams (at the end of each day?).


## The goal of this event

The goal for this event is ...

CH thoughts:
* To share knowledge of the existing architecture/tech behind Binder
* To disambiguate where the code for Binder lives, as well as the difference between BinderHub tech vs. individual Binder deployments
* To brainstorm current usecases for Binder deployments
* To brainstorm future usecases that would require new development on the core BinderHub tech
* To discuss sustainable funding models for Binder deployment time (e.g. paying google cloud)
* To discuss ways to grow the network of deployed BinderHubs
* To discuss more "far-reaching" ideas for how this could be integrated into academic and publishing workflows .

## Agenda
Below here each section is one section of the agenda

### Logistics

Where and when am I? Times, coffee/drinks, CoC, fire exits, how to get "not lost anymore" on campus, gitter chat, {ether, hack}pad(s), mailing list, etc.

### What is binder?

A few presentations at the beginning to showcase existing binder features and highlight deficits that we think could usefully be addressed.

* The 280character introduction to binder (10min)
* Things we know binder can't do well (10min)
* The binder demo reel (10min)
* Questions (15min)


### Unconference part

Large part of the workshop is BoF or unconference time. This means the schedule and content is made by you. We will take 15min today and tomorrow morning to create the schedule for each day.

We have three "tracks", each slot is N minutes long. Please respect the clock. Each track will have host who helps with the clock, keeping notes, etc.

We distributed post-its and pens to all of you. Any topic you want to discuss, share with others, or learn more about, write it on the post-it (one for each topic). After giving everyone time to create as many post-its as they need we will form an orderly queue, read out one of your topics, maybe add a sentence or two, put it on the board. After there are no new post-its left we will try and consolidate similar topics. After that we will try and make a schedule with as few conflicts as possible. Done.

#### Topics we will propose

A list of topics we (T, T, A, C, Y) will propose. To keep everyone an equal we should probably propose them as the normal unconference scheduling, or do we think they are so fundamental that we make these skip the queue and add it to the "Welcome" part? As we run the schedule building we can (unfairly) influence it.

**CH**: IMO we can define the conversation via pre-specifying the talks at the beginning of the first day. If there's something specific (e.g. a tutorial) then I think it should be treated differently from the "unconference" part. That's the whole point of an unconference after all :-)

### Evening events

Go for dinner with people you don't know :-)

If there is interest we will make a reservation at XXX which is a YYY kind of place. Add your name [here]() by Xhours.

**CH:** Do we imaging this will be a "9-5" kinda conference? Or do we think folks will be in late-night hacking mode at all?


## The second day

Like the first but with summary at the end instead of the start.
