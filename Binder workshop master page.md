## Likely attendees

**Tim Head** - Created Everware, similar idea to binder created at CERN

**Kacper Kowalik** - I'm a research scientist at NCSA, working with Matt Turk. I'm heavily involved in the WholeTale and the ytHub projects, which share numerous traits with both Binder and JupyterHub.

**Edwin Skidmore** - I lead team responsible for CyVerse's core infrastructure and cloud platform

**Pamela Reynolds** - Coordinator, UC Davis Data Science Initiative

**Gail Clement** - Research library admin aspiring to do our part to make research communication  more effective, useful, and openly accessible, and to support authors and publishers interested in same. Willing to cancel Elsevier and Springer journals to make this happen.

**Lisa Johnson** - Grad student with Titus

**Jessica Mizzi** - Grad student in Microbiology at UCD

**Luiz Irber** - Grad student with Titus

**Yuvi Panda** - I'm infrastructure lead at UC Berkeley's Data Science Education Program, and focus on scaling JupyterHub to large number of users. I am also a core contributor to the new BinderHub / MyBinder.org

**Karen Word** - postdoc with Titus in learning assessment, part-time with the Carpentries.

**Daniel Standage** - postdoc with Titus

**Matt Frazier** - Software engineer at Center for Open Science.

**Adelaide Rhodes** - Hi - I am transitioning to the University of Vermont, where the ability to tie together a variety of tools using binder and connecting it to other platforms will be a great help in advancing cancer and other biomedical research here at the Vermont Integrated Genomic Resource group.  We work with regional collaborators, such as the University of Maine and University of New Hampshire, advancing genomic tools using a variety of HPC and cloud platforms.

**Taylor Reiter** - Grad student with Titus

**Abigail Cabunoc Mayes** - Lead Developer, Open Source Engagement at Mozilla Foundation.

**Holly Bik** - My favorite things are roller coasters, nematodes, and awesome (open source) data visualization.

**Harriet Alexander** - Postdoc with Titus.

**Matthias Bussonnier** - I'm a post doc at UC Berkeley I have been working on IPython/Jupyter since 2011.

**Carol Willing** - Research Software Engineer, Project Jupyter.

**Olga Botvinnik** - Bioinformatics scientist at Chan Zuckerberg Biohub working on open science

**Jonathan Crabtree** - I am director of Odum Cyber Infrastructure at Chapel Hill

**Neem Serra** - I like cupcakes.

**Christie Bahlai** - Asst Prof at Kent State

**Aaron Culich** - Research Computing Architect at UC Berkeley Research IT / Berkeley Research Computing (BRC). Work closely with BIDS and Jupyter team on Binder/JupyterHub technologies for use on campus-supported infrastructure, commercial cloud computing, and national computing resources such as XSEDE Jetstream.

**Christopher Hench** - I'm a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley and fellow at BIDS, I also work at the D-Lab and Digital Humanities at Berkeley. My main interaction with Binder and JupyterHub has been teaching using it, but I've also set up and configured one for the D-Lab on gcloud with kubernetes. I think I'd be most helpful either trying out docs or helping write documentation, and brainstorming other ways to use it.

**Christopher Holdgraf** - international man of mystery.

**Clark Fitzgerald** - Statistics graduate student at UC Davis DSI
