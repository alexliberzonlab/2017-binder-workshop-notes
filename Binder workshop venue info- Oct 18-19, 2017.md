# Basic travel/venue information

## Where the binder workshop will happen

The venue for the binder workshop is the Shields Library on UC Davis campus, which is about 5 minutes walk from downtown Davis.

## Lodging information

Lodging can be booked at any of our local hotels. We have had good experience with the Hyatt Place, the Aggie Inn, and the Best Western Palm Court.

AirBNB is also a perfectly good alternative!

We suggest staying within the city of Davis, although Winters, Woodland, and West Sacramento are relatively short drives.

## Travel to and from Davis.

Davis is located about 60 miles north of the Bay Area and 20 miles west of Sacramento.

Davis can be reached in about 30 minutes from the Sacramento International Airport (SMF), and is about an hour away from Oakland Airport (OAK?), and between 2 and 3 hours away from the San Francisco airport (SFO). There is frequent serious highway congestion between Davis and the Bay Area which should be accounted for in travel plans.

Public transportation from OAK and SFO is possible via BART (metro) and Amtrak, which arrives in downtown Davis. While much of downtown Davis is walkable, lodging is typically further and we recommend using ride sharing or taxi services.

The Davis Airporter and Supershuttle can be used for transportation to and from airports, but should be reserved well in advance. Ride sharing (e.g. Lyft) works well for local travel (to/from SMF).

## Transportation needs in Davis

A car is typically not needed in Davis, as the weather is almost always good. Davis is very bike friendly and bike rentals are available on a daily basis (from Kenâ€™s Bike and Ski and also the UC Davis Bike Barn). There are also a number of ZipCar locations on and near campus for hourly car rental, and Uber and Lyft work well within town during the day and evening.

# Weather and attire.

The daily temperature in Davis in October varies between 60 and 95.

The workshops have no dress requirement and informal-wear (flip-flops and shorts!) are fine, although we do also have strong functioning air conditioning in the classroom, so you might also bring some warm clothes.
